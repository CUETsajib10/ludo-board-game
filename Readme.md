# Ludo Board Game 

## Note
This is a "quick-and-dirty" implementation of Ludo board game in java. It is implemented as a console based game. It was a school project on java. I did it to get acquainted with java and more than that for fun. I thought to push this code just in case if anyone with similar school project was willing to get some idea or use parts of the code(or at the very least use the board text file.) 

## Executing the Game
You need to go to the directory with the source files.
Then you can run following commands on your terminal to run the game.


_javac *.java_

_java LudoGame_


Or you can simply run the script file.

_sh runGame.sh_

## Game Description
Ludo (from Latin ludo, "I play") is a board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to die rolls. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names. (From Wikipedia)
